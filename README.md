rcat
====

rcat is a (very) minimalistic implementation of the Unix cat utility in Rust. It probably sucks too.

# Purpose

I have written this program just to get started with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It should not be used for anything serious.

# Build and Usage

Provided that Rust is already installed:

```cargo run --verbose -- test.txt```
